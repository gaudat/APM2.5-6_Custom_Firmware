/*
This library configures the pin connected to ATMEGA2560 so that it can read
the PPM signal sent from the ATMEGA32U4.
This library aims to be as "low-level" as possible so that by default the platform
will always function as an effective servo signal gateway.

Although the are lots of tutorials about timers and interrupts online, when using
a new device often times I like to consult the avr-libc user manual!
